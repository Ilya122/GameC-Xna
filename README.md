GameC-Xna
=========

Game classes for XNA. This is for common actions like a sprite or an animation.. Credit mover or particles. This is incomplete of course and lack many actions.

Written by me (ILYA).

*You may use it for learning purposes and creating your game\libraries. 
DO NOT make a shallow copy and claim it for yourself.
DO NOT sell it (Wth ? who would...) 
If you do, I'll find you and get you ;)
